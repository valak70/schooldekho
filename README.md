# SchoolDekho

## Overview
**SchoolDekho** is a mini web app built with **Next.js** and **MySQL** to add and explore schools.  
It includes a form for adding schools (with image upload) and a grid view to browse them.

## Features
- Add school details (name, address, city, state, contact, email, image) with validation
- Browse schools in a responsive grid with images and info
- Edit and delete school entries (protected, only for logged-in users)
- OTP-based user registration and login system
- Conditional rendering based on user authentication
- Fully responsive UI with modern CSS modules
- Image upload support (local storage or Cloudinary)


## Tech Stack
- **Next.js (App Router)**  
- **MySQL**  
- **CSS Modules**
  
## Deployment Information

This project is deployed at: [https://schooldekho.onrender.com/](https://schooldekho.onrender.com/) (Render termporarily shuts the service when inactive so you might have to wait for a minute on the page while render restarts the service)

### Infrastructure and Services Used

- **Database:** AWS RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service) MySQL instance.  
  A managed, highly available MySQL database hosted on AWS powering the backend data store.

- **Image Storage:** Cloudinary.  
  Cloudinary is used for storing and serving school images in production, ensuring reliable, scalable image management.

- **Hosting Platform:** Render.com  
  The Next.js application is hosted on Render's managed server platform, supporting persistent server processes and environment variable management.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/valak70/schooldekho.git
   cd schooldekho
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file at the project root with your MySQL credentials:

   ```
    DB_HOST=your_database_host
    DB_USER=your_database_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    DB_NAME=your_database_name
   
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name    # Cloudinary Credentials(optional)
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    USE_CLOUDINARY=true    #Use Cloudinary in production (set to 'true' for prod, 'false' for local file saving)

    JWT_SECRET=replace_with_strong_random_secret
    
    # If using Gmail OAuth2 
    EMAIL_SECRET=replace_with_email_token_secret
    EMAIL_USER=you@example.com
    OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
    OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
    OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_oauth_refresh_token
    OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
   
   ```
- Set `USE_CLOUDINARY=true` when deploying to production to enable Cloudinary uploads.
- For local development or environments without Cloudinary, set `USE_CLOUDINARY=false` or omit this variable to fall back to saving images locally in the `/public/schoolImages/` folder.
4. **Set up MySQL database**

   Create the tables using SQL commands in tableSchema.sql in root directory

5. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the app**

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


### Database Setup Caution
- Use schoolData.sql from root directory to populate sample school data(Just copy the entire file and paste it as mysql query inside your database).
- Make sure the MySQL user you use has privileges to access and modify the database.
- If you encounter "Access denied" errors, verify that the user has the necessary privileges.

### How to Deploy

1. Push your code with proper `.env` configuration to GitHub or equivalent repository.

2. Connect your repository to [Render.com](https://render.com) and create a new Web Service.

3. In Renderâ€™s dashboard, add the environment variables from above with your actual credentials.

4. Deploy and monitor logs for build success.

5. Access your live app at [https://schooldekho.onrender.com/](https://schooldekho.onrender.com/).

### Notes

- **File Uploads:**  
  Local image uploads are only suitable for local development due to ephemeral file storage in cloud hosting. Use Cloudinary in production.

- **Database Access:**  
  Ensure AWS RDS security groups allow inbound connections from your Render service's IP or CIDR range.

## Roadmap / Future Plans

- **School Detail Page:**  
  Add a dedicated page to view detailed information about each school.

- **Search & Filter in ShowSchools:**  
  Implement search and filtering options to easily find schools by name, city, or state.

- **Image Upload Improvements:**  
  Support multiple images and better image handling.

- **API Improvements:**  
  Add pagination, sorting, and better error handling to API endpoints.
