It includes a form for adding schools (with image upload) and a grid view to browse them.

## Features
- Add school details (name, address, city, state, contact, email, image) with validation  
- Browse schools in a responsive grid with images and info  
- Reusable Navbar & simple landing page with background + CTA  
- Fully responsive UI with modern CSS modules  
- MySQL integration for storing and fetching school data  

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js (App Router)**  
- **MySQL**  
- **CSS Modules**
  
## Deployment Information

This project is deployed at: [https://schooldekho.onrender.com/](https://schooldekho.onrender.com/)

### Infrastructure and Services Used

- **Database:** AWS RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service) MySQL instance.  
  A managed, highly available MySQL database hosted on AWS powering the backend data store.

- **Image Storage:** Cloudinary.  
  Cloudinary is used for storing and serving school images in production, ensuring reliable, scalable image management.

- **Hosting Platform:** Render.com  
  The Next.js application is hosted on Render's managed server platform, supporting persistent server processes and environment variable management.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/valak70/schooldekho.git
   cd schooldekho
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file at the project root with your MySQL credentials:

   ```
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_USER=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DB_NAME=your_database_name

    Cloudinary Credentials(optional)
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    
    Use Cloudinary in production (set to 'true' for prod, 'false' for local file saving)
    USE_CLOUDINARY=true
   
   ```
- Set `USE_CLOUDINARY=true` when deploying to production to enable Cloudinary uploads.
- For local development or environments without Cloudinary, set `USE_CLOUDINARY=false` or omit this variable to fall back to saving images locally in the `/public/schoolImages/` folder.
4. **Set up MySQL database**

   Create the `schools` table using this SQL command:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE schools (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     name TEXT NOT NULL,
     address TEXT NOT NULL,
     city TEXT NOT NULL,
     state TEXT NOT NULL,
     contact VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
     image TEXT NOT NULL,
     email_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

5. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the app**

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


### Database Setup Caution
- Use schoolData.sql from root directory to populate sample school data(Just copy the entire file and paste it as mysql query inside your database).
- Make sure the MySQL user you use has privileges to access and modify the database.
- If you encounter "Access denied" errors, verify that the user has the necessary privileges.


### How to Deploy

1. Push your code with proper `.env` configuration to GitHub or equivalent repository.

2. Connect your repository to [Render.com](https://render.com) and create a new Web Service.

3. In Renderâ€™s dashboard, add the environment variables from above with your actual credentials.

4. Deploy and monitor logs for build success.

5. Access your live app at [https://schooldekho.onrender.com/](https://schooldekho.onrender.com/).

### Notes

- **File Uploads:**  
  Local image uploads are only suitable for local development due to ephemeral file storage in cloud hosting. Use Cloudinary in production.

- **Database Access:**  
  Ensure AWS RDS security groups allow inbound connections from your Render service's IP or CIDR range.

- **Secrets Management:**  
  Never commit `.env.local` or secrets to version control. Use Render environment variables securely.
